    <p>Conversion Gel is a white fluid that allows the Portal gun to place portals on surfaces that would normally be unfit for placing portals. Several areas in the Condemned Testing Facility seem to indicate that the Conversion Gel was used to paint all further testing facilities, explaining how only white-painted walls were affected by the Portal Gun.<br><br>
      According to a pre-recorded message from Cave Johnson, the Conversion Gel is made up of ground-up Moon rocks, as they are an excellent portal-conducting surface, although contributing to Cave's death due to being poisonous.</p>
